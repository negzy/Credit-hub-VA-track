## Tips for Consistency

1. **Start each shift the same way:** Open dashboard → Review → Begin tasks
2. **End each shift the same way:** Update metrics → Write handoff → Save
3. **Use templates consistently:** Always customize, but use the same base structure
4. **Check Post Guidelines every time:** Don't skip this step
5. **One question rule:** Always remember - ONE question only, then direct to next step

---

## Emergency Protocol

If something urgent comes up:
1. Mark it as High priority immediately
2. Add it to handoff note with ⚠️ symbol
3. If it needs immediate attention, note it clearly
4. Don't try to handle emergencies yourself - flag for Emmanuel

## Notes

- This cadence is flexible - adjust timing if needed, but try to hit all tasks
- Quality over quantity - better to do fewer things well than rush through everything
- Consistency is key - same process every day makes it easier and faster
- Always leave a clear handoff note - Emmanuel relies on this to know what happened
