- Mark priority as "High" for anything that needs immediate attention
- Update status to "In Progress" when you start working on it

### **30 Minutes: Reply to Comments (Engagement Queue)**
- Open the Engagement Queue table
- Start with High priority items, then Medium, then Low
- For each comment:
  1. Click the link to open the post/comment
  2. Read the full context
  3. Choose the appropriate template from the Templates section
  4. Customize the template (replace [Name], add personal touches)
  5. Copy and paste your reply
  6. Update the Status to "Done" in the queue
  7. Add any notes about the interaction

**Response Types:**

### **30 Minutes: Emmanuel Admin DMs + Follow-ups**
- Open the DM Queue
- Filter by "Follow-up date" = today
- For each DM:
  1. Read what they asked originally
  2. Check their Qualification stage
  3. Follow the rule: **ONE question only** if they show intent, then direct to next step
  4. Use appropriate template (DM Follow-up, Book a Call Redirect, etc.)

- Either:
  - Post a new engagement prompt (use "Post Your Win Prompt" template)
  - OR bump an existing thread that's getting good engagement
- Add a relevant GIF to make it more engaging
