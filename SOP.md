## Functionality at a glance (everything you need)

|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Today’s 2-hour plan** | Top of dashboard | Check off each task; use “Reset Daily Tasks” to start fresh. |
| **Engagement Queue (Skool comments)** | First table | Add row (+ Add Comment), edit any cell, use **✓ Done** to set status to Done, or type Status: New / In Progress / Done. **Delete** if you added by mistake. |
| **DM + Follow-up Queue** | Second table | Same: add (+ Add DM), **✓ Done** for quick Done, edit Status, Delete if mistake. |
| **Quick Metrics** | Metrics section | Click each number to edit; update at end of shift. |
| **Templates** | Templates section | Click a template (or “Copy”) to copy; paste into Skool/DM and customize. |

| **Handoff note** | End-of-shift box | Type your note, click “Save Handoff Note”. |
| **Report for Emmanuel** | Same box | Click “Generate report for Emmanuel” → “Copy report” → paste into shared Google Doc (or email/Slack). |
| **Status on queue rows** | Status column in each table | Use the dropdown: **New**, **In Progress**, or **Done**. |
| **I am (VA name)** | Top of dashboard | Select your name (Elmo, Soc, etc.) so the report says "Report from: [you]". |

## When there are multiple VAs

- **Same link, same dashboard** — everyone uses the same URL. Your tasks and queues are on your own device (they don't sync).
- **Always select your name** ("I am: Elmo" / "Soc" / etc.) so the report says "Report from: [your name]". Emmanuel needs to see who did what.
- **One shared Doc for everyone** — Emmanuel pastes the Doc link in "For Emmanuel" at the bottom. All VAs paste their end-of-shift report into that same Doc. Each report is labeled with your name.
- **Queues:** If you need one shared list (so no one double-replies), use one shared Google Sheet for Engagement + DM queues; everyone updates it. Use the dashboard for templates, tasks, and generating your report.

  - Post a new engagement prompt (use "Post Your Win Prompt" template)
  - OR bump an existing thread that's getting good engagement
- Add a relevant GIF to make it more engaging

   - Replace `{{BOOKING_LINK}}` with the actual booking link
   - Add personal touches (emojis, specific details from their message)
   - Make it sound human, not robotic

**Important:** Templates are starting points. Always personalize them!

## Deleting queue items

- You can **delete** a row if you added it by mistake: click **Delete** on that row and confirm. Use this for duplicates or wrong entries. Data is saved automatically.

---

## Post Guidelines

**Before posting ANYTHING in any group:**
1. Check the Post Guidelines section in the dashboard
2. Read the rules for that specific group
3. Make sure your post follows:
   - Do's (what's encouraged)
   - Don'ts (what's not allowed)
4. If unsure, don't post - leave a note in handoff for Emmanuel

## Google Sheets Integration

### **Setting Up:**
1. Import `google-sheets-template.csv` into Google Sheets
2. You'll have three tabs: Engagement Queue, DM Queue, Quick Metrics
3. Update the dashboard manually OR copy/paste from sheets

### **Weekly Sync:**
- At end of week, copy data from dashboard to Google Sheets
- This creates a backup and allows Emmanuel to review trends

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboard not saving?**
- Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Templates not loading?**
- Make sure `templates.txt` is in the same folder as `dashboard.html`
- You can edit templates.txt directly to add/change templates

**Need to reset daily tasks?**
- Click "Reset Daily Tasks" button
- This unchecks all tasks (useful if you want to start fresh)
